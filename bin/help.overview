Manages versions of the TigerVNC Java Viewer. It downloads jar files
from BinTray and creates a wrapper script that runs it using the Java VM
in the PATH.

Additionally, it supports desktop integration via the custom "integrate"
and "unintegrate" commands. "integrate" creates a desktop file and an
icon for each installed viewer version. "unintegrate" removes them all,
including files for versions that no longer installed.
